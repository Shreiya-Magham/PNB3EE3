<h1>What I learned today</h1>
<p>I learned about why we are using GitHub in this course, the difference between Git and GitHub, as well as basic git functions. PNB 3EE3 uses GitHub because it's an online cloud service that keeps track of any changes anyone has made to a project or repository. GitHub keeps a record of different versions of a repository, and various edits that people have made to it. This is crucial, especially in research, to maintain a level of transparency with data and files, while making sure the researchers' original work and data remains intact. Git is similar in function in that it takes "snapshots" of what your repositories look like as you edit them, but is installed locally on people's computers rather than a cloud server. Some basic git functions include git init (creates repositories with your code, materials, and analyses), git clone (which copies remote repositories), git commit (which "snapshots" the code), git pull (which pulls the most recent version of the repository), and git push (which allows people to share changes to the cloud where collaborators can see the changes you've made). In addition to all of this, I learned more about the command line interface (which involved 'Terminal' on my Mac), GitHub CLI, and how to connect GitHub to RStudio on my computer. I needed to make further changes to this paragraph, and I used the git push command specifically for that. Overall, I learned a lot of new things in tutorial. </p>
